Through this project, we aim to build a Chrome extension that will help dyslexic individuals in reading website content by providing customized content and visual aids.


## Why We Built This

Our motivation stems from a commitment to inclusivity and equal access to information. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to engage with online content effectively, regardless of their learning differences. By developing this Chrome extension, we aim to level the playing field and empower dyslexic individuals to explore the wealth of knowledge available on the web with confidence.
